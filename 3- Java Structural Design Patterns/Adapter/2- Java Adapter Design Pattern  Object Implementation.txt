													Participants :
			- Target
				- Defines the domain-specific interface that client uses.
				
			- Client
				- Collaborates with objects conforming to the Target interface.
				
			- Adaptee
				- Defines an existing interface that needs adapting.
				
			- Adapter
				- Adapts the interface of Adaptee to the Target interface.
				- Involves a single class which is responsible to join functionalities
					of independent or interface.
					
													 Client Usage:
		
			- Client makes a request to the adapter by calling a method on it using the target interface
			
			- The Adapter translates the request into one or more calls on the adaptee using the adaptee interface
			
			- The client receives the results of the call and never knows there is an adapter doing the translation
			
			- Essentially, client call operations on an Adapter instance
				- In turn, the Adapter calls adaptee operations that carry out the request
				
													    Summary :
														
			- Adapters vary in the amount of work they do to adapt adaptee to the Target interface
			
				- Simple interface conversion 
					(changing the names of operations to supporting an entirely different set of operations)
				- The amount of work the Adapter does depends on how similar the target interface is to the adaptee's
			
			- Adapter frees you from worrying about existing interfaces
			
			- If i have a class that does what i need, I know that i can always use the adapter
				pattern to give it the correct interface
