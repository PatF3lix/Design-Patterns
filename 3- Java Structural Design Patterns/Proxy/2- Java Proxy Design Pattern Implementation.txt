							Proxy Design Pattern
								Implimentation
	
		Participants
	
	- Subject
		- Defines the common interface for RealSubject and Proxy.
			- A Proxy can be used anywhere a RealSubject is expected.
		
	- Proxy
		- Clients interact with the RealSubject through the Proxy.
		- Maintains a reference that lets the proxy access the real subject.
			- Controls access to the real subject and may be responsible for creating and deleting it.
				- May be needed if the Subject is running on a remote machine.
				- May be needed if the Subject is expensive to create in some way or if access.
					to the subject needs to be protected in some way.
			- Forwards requests to RealSubject when appropriate (delegation).
				- Depending on type of proxy.
	
	- Provides an interface identical to Subject's so that a proxy can be substituted forthe real subject.
	- May refer to a Subject if the RealSubject and Subject interfaces are the same.
	
	- Other responsibilities depend on the kind of proxy.
		- Remote proxies are responsible for encoding a request and its arguments and for sending the encoded request
			to the real subject in a different address space.
		- Virtual proxies may cache additional information about the real subject so that they can postpone accessing it.
		- Protection proxies check that the caller has access permissions required to perform a request.
	- Has the authority to act on behalf of the client to interact with the target object.
