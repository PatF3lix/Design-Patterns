										Memento Design Pattern 
		
		*Overview*
		
	- The mementto design pattern will capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object
		can be restored to this state later, without violating encapsulation
	
	- The goal is to save the state of an object, so that in the future, we can go back to the specified state
	
	- Implemented in such a way that the saved state data of the object is not accessible
		outside of the object
	
		- protects the integrity of saved state data
		- doesn't break encapsulation
	
	- You can use this pattern when you want to be able to return an object to one of its prvious states
		- If your user requests an "undo"
	
		*Examples*
	
	- In notepad we use undo frequently by pressing ctrl + z
	
	- A classic example includes the state in a finite state machine
	
	- In real-world database programming we often need to roll back a transaction operation
	
	- In a video game, a "save progress" option
		- Player can store their game progress and at least recover most of their efforts when their character dies
		- "Save progress" function would return a player to the last level he/she completed successfully
	
	- A graphical editor that supports connectivity between objects
		- A user can connect two rectangles with a line
		- The rectangles stay connected when the user moves either of them
		- The editor ensures that the line streches to maintain the connection
	
		*Why the memento?*
	
	- Sometimes it is necessary to record the internal state of an object
		- required when implementing checkpoints and undo mechanisms
			- lets users back out of tentative operations or recover from errors
	
	- You must save state information somewhere so that you can restore objects to their previous states
	
	- Objects normally encapsulates some or all of their state
		- Making it inaccessible to other objects and impossible to save externally
		- Exposing this state would violate encapsulation
			- Can compromise the application's reliability and extensibility
	
	- The memento address the above issues without violating encapsulation
	
		*Advantages and drawbacks*
	
	- Simple and easy to implementing
	
	- Provides easy-to-implement recovery capability
	
	- A drawback to using Memento is that saving and restoring state can be time consuming
		- Consider using Serialization to save a system's state
